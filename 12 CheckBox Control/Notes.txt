Checkbox control is used when you want the user to select more thatn one option from the available choices. For example, the education of a person, A person can have a graduate degree, post graduate degree, and a doctrate. In this case the user selects all the 3 checkboxes. Where as a person, may just have a graduate degree, in which case he only selects the graduate checkbox. 
Another example would be when you want the user to select the days of his availability
In short if you want to provide the user with more than one option to select from, then choose a checkbox control. We can also you checkbox list control for the same purpose. 

Properties of Checkbox Control:

TextAllign: Right or Left. On which side of the check box the text should appear.
AutoPostBack: Set this property to true, if yuo want the webform to be posted immediately when the checked status of the checkbox changed
