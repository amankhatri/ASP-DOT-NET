/*you can go to the root directory of the project by right clicking on the project, not the solution, and

 2) right click the pageInRootDirecotory.aspx and select open in browser, now the path which appears in the address
 bar of the broswer (http://localhost:53616/PageInRootDirectory.aspx) is the vitrual path created by browser 
 for the pageinRoot directgory. THis is a virtual path and there is a real physical path. Virtual path is 
 associated with real path and we can use MapPath method to relate these two paths
 
 3) Server.MapPath() method gives the physical path for a given virtual Path. This method can be used in several different ways 
 depending on characters that we use in the virtual path
