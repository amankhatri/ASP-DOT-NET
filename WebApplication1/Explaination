desiner.cs contains user code .
when I drag and drop it creates a button and the code behind that button is created in Default.aspx.designer.cs
and defaulx.axpx.cs contains the defalt page
in Default.aspx we have a line
<%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" MasterPageFile="~/Site.Master" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="WebApplication1._Default" %>
which is called the page directive and the attribute CodeBehind tells the what code it related to the file

codebehind files the code that user write, where as the designer file contains the autogenerated code. You should not change the code in the designer file, because that code might be modified by visalstudio and your changes could be ovewritten

A webform is associated with its codefile using @pagedirective 
<%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" MasterPageFile="~/Site.Master" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="WebApplication1._Default" %>
